Potato Engine

Potato is my take on the Hazel Engine, following Cherno's tutorials available at his youtube channel.

<sub>"Hazel is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented, however (almost) everything inside this repository is being created within YouTube videos, found at thecherno.com/engine."</sub>
